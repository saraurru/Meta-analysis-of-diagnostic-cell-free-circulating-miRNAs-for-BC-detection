# Meta-analysis-of-diagnostic-cell-free-circulating-miRNAs-for-BC-detection

The R script and the dataset used in the study entitled "Meta-analysis of diagnostic cell-free circulating microRNAs for breast cancer detection" (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-022-09698-8) are included in this repository. The R script contains the code for all reported results as well as some additional results not reported within the article. The dataset (spreadsheet) contains information on the meta-analysed studies, such as general study information, sample characteristics, diagnostic performance, etc. Additional information on the reasoning behind specific data points in the dataset can be found in the article or the R script.

The methodology of the meta-analysis was pre-registered in the international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42021229910).
